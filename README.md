  <h1>ZENSWARM ORACLE</h1>

  A zenswarm oracle is a web API whose identity is registered to a [DID controller](https://github.com/dyne/w3C-DID) and is able to run zencode smart contract (through [restroom-mw](https://github.com/dyne/restroom-mw)).

This repository contains some utilities that allow a user to
- generate a keyring (which defines the identity of the oracle)
- announce (i.e. register) the oracle to the DID controller
- run a express service which provides all of the restroom-mw middlewares
- deannounce (aka goodbye) the oracle identity

## üî® Usage
Before using Zenswarm oracle you need:
* Zenroom
* Jq
* Docker
* Restroom-test

The `secrets` directory will be shared with the zenswarm oracle container.
For example, this will let the oracle read the keyring we are going to generate.

The first step is to generate the keyring of the oracle
```bash
  make keygen DESCRIPTION="test oracle"
```
This command will generate a file `secrets/keys.json` with the newly created keyring.

Then, one has to announce the oracle to the DID controller. 
For this step, one need an admin keyring (if you want to try please contact us at [info@dyne.org](info@dyne.org).
```bash
  make announce SIGN_KEYRING=...
```

At this point, one can run the oracle instance
```bash
  TODO
```


Finally, one can deannounce the oracle
```bash
  make goodbye SIGN_KEYRING=...
```
