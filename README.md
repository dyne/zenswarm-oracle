  <h1>ZENSWARM ORACLE</h1>

  A zenswarm oracle is a web API whose identity is registered to a [DID controller](https://github.com/dyne/w3C-DID) and is able to run zencode smart contract (through [restroom-mw](https://github.com/dyne/restroom-mw)).

This repository contains some utilities that allow a user to
- generate a keyring (which defines the identity of the oracle)
- announce (i.e. register) the oracle to the DID controller
- run a express service which provides all of the restroom-mw middlewares
- deannounce (aka goodbye) the oracle identity

## üî® Usage
Before using Zenswarm oracle you need:
* [Zenroom](https://zenroom.org/#downloads)
* Jq
* Docker
* [Restroom-test](https://github.com/dyne/zencode-tools/releases/latest/)

The `SECRET` directory will be shared with the zenswarm oracle container (by default is called `secrets`).
For example, this will let the oracle read the keyring we are going to generate.

The following commands also need a restroom instance with an Admin Keyring, you have to set the variables `RR_HOST`, `RR_PORT`, `RR_SCHEMA` and `RR_API` in the Makefile.

The first step is to generate the keyring of the oracle
```bash
  make keygen DESCRIPTION="test oracle"
```
This command will generate a file `secrets/keys.json` with the newly created keyring.

Then, one has to announce the oracle to the DID controller. 
```bash
  make announce URL=`IP or FQDN`
```
This command will generate two files:
* `secrets/DID.json` with the the DID;
* `secrets/DID_document.json` with the the DID document and the DID document metadata;

At this point, one can run the oracle instance
```bash
  make build
  make run ORACLE_TYPE=common ORACLE_NAME=first-oracle
```
That will be launched on localhost on port 3000. To see the available contracts visit http://localhost:3000/docs.

To stop the container simply run
```
  make kill
```

Finally, once the oracle is no more needed, one have to deannounce the oracle to the DID controller.
```bash
  make goodbye
```

## Oracle Flow

### Distributor
First of all, you have to start a distributor. It will keep a list of announced oracles, it will announce new oracles and dsitribute a request at random.

One can start a distributor oracle using
```
make run ORACLE_TYPE=distributor
```

It will expose and API that will let other oracle announce.
During this phase it will have to:
1. record its domain name in redis;
1. authorize its public key (with a call to a smart contract);
1. (TODO: record its DID).

### Common
During startup it will have to announce to a distributor, by sending a JSON like
```
{
  "domain_name": "....",
  "address": "....",
  ....?
}
```
using the command
```
make announce
```

And can start the oracle with
```
make run ORACLE_TYPE=common
```

At this point, the node owner can submit the signature of its address to the Smart Contract
