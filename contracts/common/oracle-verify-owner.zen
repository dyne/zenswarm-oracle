Scenario ethereum:

Given I have a 'ethereum signature'
Given I have a 'ethereum address' named 'oracle'
Given I have a 'hex' named 'message'
Given I have a 'string' named 'owner' 
When I append 'owner' to 'message'

When I verify the 'message' has a ethereum signature in 'ethereum signature' by 'oracle'

Then print the string 'The signature is valid'
