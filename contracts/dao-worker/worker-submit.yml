      addresses

      # and we return the results as an array


      # Here we load the signatures array, the adresses array and the messages

      # the arrays can be of arbitrary length, but elements of the respective
      arrays have to match

      and 'loop address'


      Foreach 'loop_signature' in 'signatures'

      Foreach 'loop_address' in 'addresses'

      the verification succeeds

      # here we have a conditional statement that verifies the transaction:

      # if succeded, the status is changed to 'verified'

      If I verify the 'signed-string' has a ethereum signature in

      When I create the signed ethereum transaction for chain 'chain id'


      Then print the 'signed ethereum transaction'


      Then print the 'new array'
