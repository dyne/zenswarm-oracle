Scenario ecdh: Verify the signature

# Here we load the ECDSA public key, the message and the signature 
Given I have a 'ecdh public key'
Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'signed_message'
Given I have a 'ecdh signature'

# Here we verify the signature
When I verify the 'signed_message' has a ecdh signature in 'ecdsa signature' by 'ecdsa public key'

# If the verification is successful, the next string is printed 
Then print string 'The ECDSA signature was verified'
